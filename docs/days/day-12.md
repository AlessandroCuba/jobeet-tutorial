# Jobeet Day 12: The API

When you post a job, you will want to have the greatest exposure possible.
If your job is syndicated on a lot of small websites, you will have a better chance to find the right person. That's the power of the [long tail][1].
Affiliates will be able to publish the latest posted jobs on their websites thanks to the web services we will develop along this day.

## Affiliates
As per [day 2](day-2.md) requirements:

> "Story F7: An affiliate retrieves the current active job list"

### The Fixtures

> Note! There was a change in day 3: in file `src/Entity/Affiliate.php` method `setCategories` was replaced by two methods
> `addCategory` and `removeCategory`. Please check if you have these methods in Affiliate class and compare it with file from [day 3](day-3.md).

Letâ€™s create a new fixture file for the affiliates:

```php
namespace App\DataFixtures;

use App\Entity\Affiliate;
use Doctrine\Bundle\FixturesBundle\Fixture;
use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\OrderedFixtureInterface;
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class AffiliateFixtures extends Fixture implements OrderedFixtureInterface
{
    /**
     * @param ObjectManager $manager
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function load(ObjectManager $manager) : void
    {
        $affiliateSensioLabs = new Affiliate();
        $affiliateSensioLabs->setUrl('http://www.sensiolabs.com/');
        $affiliateSensioLabs->setEmail('contact@sensiolabs.com');
        $affiliateSensioLabs->setActive(true);
        $affiliateSensioLabs->setToken('sensio_labs');
        $affiliateSensioLabs->addCategory($manager->merge($this->getReference('category-programming')));

        $affiliateKNPLabs = new Affiliate();
        $affiliateKNPLabs->setUrl('http://www.knplabs.com/');
        $affiliateKNPLabs->setEmail('hello@knplabs.com');
        $affiliateKNPLabs->setActive(true);
        $affiliateKNPLabs->setToken('knp_labs');
        $affiliateKNPLabs->addCategory($manager->merge($this->getReference('category-programming')));
        $affiliateKNPLabs->addCategory($manager->merge($this->getReference('category-design')));

        $manager->persist($affiliateSensioLabs);
        $manager->persist($affiliateKNPLabs);

        $manager->flush();
    }

    /**
     * @return int
     */
    public function getOrder() : int
    {
        return 3;
    }
}
```
